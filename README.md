## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/vivekkdagar/TicTacAI/blob/main/assets/screenshot.png)

## Gameplay

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Option to choose whether the human player or AI starts the game first. 
- Players take turns marking a cell with their symbol ('X' or 'O').
- To input their symbol, players use the numpad (1 to 9) corresponding to the grid cells as follows:
  
  ```
  1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
  4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
  7 | 8 | 9
  ```

  For example, to place their symbol in the top-left cell, a player would input '1', and for the bottom-right cell, they would input '9'.

- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Technical Implementation Highlights

- Demonstrates a modular code structure that enhances readability, maintainability, and extensibility of the game.

- Showcases robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs and unexpected scenarios, enhancing user experience and software reliability.

- Scalability: Extendable codebase for future feature additions or modifications.
